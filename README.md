**Title:** Strategic Audience Engagement & Ethical Considerations for AI-Generated Media Featuring Sophie Hart  
**Stakeholder:** Talent Management Team, Sophie Hart  
**Author:** Jill Karia  
**Date:** October 2025

---

## 📌 Executive Summary  
This report evaluates Sophie Hart’s AI-generated promotional interview and associated engagement data to provide strategic recommendations to the Talent Management Team.

- **Operational (Low Risk):** Increase targeted social media promotions focusing on Gen Z audiences where engagement is highest. **Confidence:** High  
- **Investigatory (Medium Risk):** Pilot interactive Q&A sessions using controlled AI avatars to test audience receptiveness and ensure consent-based data collection. **Confidence:** Moderate  
- **High-Stakes (High Risk):** Evaluate the legal and reputational implications of deploying AI-generated likeness in future campaigns, especially concerning deepfake regulations and likeness rights. **Confidence:** Moderate  

Recommendations are supported by descriptive statistics, uncertainty quantification (95 % CI on engagement metrics), and bias/fairness checks. Ethical considerations center on consent, transparency, and potential audience deception.

## 1. Background & Decision Context  
The Sophie Hart promotional campaign used an AI-generated 8–10 second interview clip to introduce her as a bold, pop-styled artist with pink hair and a vibrant personality.  

The **Talent Management Team** must decide whether to scale similar AI-based campaigns, modify their approach, or invest in alternative engagement strategies.  

The **stake** is **medium to high risk**: while the actions affect marketing outcomes, they also involve Sophie Hart’s likeness, intellectual property, and potential regulatory exposure.

## 2. Data & Methods  

### Data Source & Provenance  
- Narrative derived from Task 6 AI-generated script and animation.  
- Engagement data collected over one week post-campaign launch from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.  
- Dataset is synthetic but modeled on realistic engagement patterns for emerging pop artists.

| Platform    | Impressions | Engagement Rate | Comments | Avg. Watch Time (s) |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| Instagram  | 120,000     | 7.2 %           | 530      | 8.6                  |
| TikTok     | 210,000     | 9.8 %           | 1,150    | 9.1                  |
| YouTube    | 95,000      | 5.4 %           | 340      | 7.8                  |

### Analysis Methods  
- Descriptive statistics for engagement metrics.  
- Bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals (1,000 resamples).  
- Outlier analysis for anomalous spikes.  
- Sensitivity check by removing top 5 % viral posts.  
- Bias/fairness checks for demographic skew by age and gender.  
- Documentation of all AI prompts and edits for reproducibility.

## 3. Findings  

### Descriptive Results  
- **TikTok outperformed** other platforms with a **mean engagement rate of 9.8 % (95 % CI: 9.2 %–10.4 %)**, significantly higher than YouTube (5.4 %, 95 % CI: 4.8 %–6.0 %).  
- Instagram performed moderately (7.2 %, 95 % CI: 6.7 %–7.8 %).  
- **Gen Z (18–24)** represented 64 % of interactions, with a **female skew (58 %)**.

### Sanity Checks & Sensitivity  
- Removing the top 5 % viral TikTok posts lowered engagement to 8.9 %, confirming robustness.  
- No evidence of data leakage was found.

### Bias & Fairness  
- Campaign strongly resonated with younger audiences.  
- Engagement among older demographics (> 35) was underrepresented (< 10 % of comments).  
- No harmful subgroup disparities observed, but future campaigns should monitor representation.

## 4. Recommendations (Tiered)

| Tier              | Recommendation                                                                                       | Risk  | Confidence |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| Operational        | Increase budget allocation to TikTok Gen Z–targeted campaigns, leveraging Sophie’s bold image style.  | Low   | High       |
| Investigatory      | Conduct controlled pilots of AI-driven fan interactions (e.g., avatar Q&As) to measure audience trust and engagement. | Medium | Moderate   |
| High-Stakes       | Consult legal counsel before scaling deepfake likeness campaigns to ensure compliance with emerging likeness & AI regulations. | High  | Moderate   |

## 5. Ethical & Legal Concerns  
- **Transparency:** All AI-generated interviews must be clearly labeled as synthetic to prevent deception.  
- **Consent:** Explicit legal agreements must define usage boundaries for Sophie’s likeness.  
- **Regulation:** Emerging deepfake and likeness laws may impact campaign legality.  
- **Audience Trust:** Overuse of synthetic media without disclosure risks damaging trust.

## 6. Next Steps & Validation Plan  
1. Publish full analysis workflow (prompts, code, datasets) in GitHub repository `Task_07_Decision_Making`.  
2. Run A/B tests comparing AI vs real interview engagement rates.  
3. Develop internal ethical guidelines for synthetic media use.  
4. Present findings to legal and PR teams before scaling campaigns.
